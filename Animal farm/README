Welcome to our ‚ÄúAnimal farm‚Äù project!!! ‚∏ú(ÔΩ°ÀÉ ·µï ÀÇ )‚∏ù‚ô°

In this game you‚Äôll play as a cute farmer rabbit that lives on a farm. The goal of the game is to balance the rabbit‚Äôs hunger,
thirst and sleep stats. This can be achieved by making sure the rabbit has food to eat, drinks water regularly and rests.
All the food in the game is planted and harvested by the rabbit itself.
